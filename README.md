tweaks to an existing thumblr theme

# Why Tumblr?
You may ask yourself, self, how did i get here? Same as it ever was, tinkering. Tumblr is a pretty powerful platform for hosting a simple portfolio and allowed me to bypass a few issues that were starting to come up:

	Issues:
		Sustainability
		http:// vs https://
		money
		Form vs design

# Sustainability
Increasingly my older portfolio became a lesson in really what not do to these days, yes knowing how to hand code an entire site is amazing, but trying to sustain that (even with php includes for commonly reused things) was becoming a nightmare, and also, was starting to show its age. It looks great, but it was aging.

# http:// vs https://
It seemed like I would get a call from godaddy at least once or twice a week asking if I wanted to purchase an SSL certificate, or other verisons of a secure server, with the push in recent used to go to secure content, I frankly wanted out of the arms race, this ties perfectly into the next issue, which is money.
# money
While paying for a domain and hosting is not expensive, it does add up, to something that ultimately as an individual doesnt seem to matter much there are plenty of platforms out there that allow for free sites with minimal watermarking and a fair amount of creativity which is paramount. What can I do to conquer form vs design, or even form vs function
# Form vs design
What form did my site take, back in the hand coded days? a blog. a straight up blog roll with some menu items. This kind of site could have been accomplished in wordpress (with a lot heavier of a footprint and potential overhead). Wordpress is a free open source platform that allows the user to kind of do whatever they want, within reason. And yet, wordpress has gotten a bad reputation in the web development community. So, if my portfolio was nothing but a blog, whats the best blog platform that I know if, that I have used for YEARS, well, that would be tumblr. Now, tumblr was bought a few years ago by Yahoo, and who knows what Yahoo was thinking then, or is thinking now, but for now I am good. I understand that should something happen to tumblr within the next few years my site is likely gone, but that is the nature of the beast.
