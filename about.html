<p>My name is James Hood, I am a Full Stack Web Developer. I work with a wide array of tools. My languages include: PHP/MySQL, Javascript, Jquery, HTML(5), CSS(3), Actionscript 2.0/3.0, XML, ASP.net (C# and VB) and a smattering of C++, XSLT, Java. I have worked as a graphic designer and as a web developer, and in my own personal freelance work I have often been both at the same time. Recently I have brought new skills into my briefcase, these include: Shipping and Logistics, Ecommerce data entry, Amazon Vendor Central compliance, EDI data exchange as well as Quickbooks online. I have become more than just a Web Developer, and much more than just a face in the crowd.</p>
<p>These days its refreshing to find someone who can do multiple things, who can learn multiple skills, and run with that. The days of 1 skill per 1 employee is over. That just doesnt work these days.</p>
<p>I have had the pleasure of working with some very talented individuals, and I have made an impression:</p>

<p>James has worked as a contractor for our advisor website offering. He learned a new platform for both him and us (Sitecore) and helped migrate >3000 advisor websites from a legacy platform onto the new platform within a very aggressive 6 month time period. He always took on the more complicated sites for the team. Shortly after the initial migration project, we asked James to work on moving more advanced and complex advisor sites onto the new Sitecore platform.
</p>
<p>Moreover, James trained and provided leadership to the other contractors brought on to assist with the migration project. He was helpful and always helped out with side projects as needed. His varied technical skillset from prior roles have been extremely beneficial to our team and we will miss him when his contract ends.</p>

<p>James is a great cross-functional partner to have on any team. He has always done a great job in communication as well as execution for site updates.
